title: "chartjs - A Chart.js implementation in R"
---

***

chartjs is an implementation of the popular JavaScript vizualisation library [**Chart.js**](www.chartjs.org).

## Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub *via* the **devtools** package: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tutuchan/chartjs")
```


## Charts

The 6 charts types available in **Chart.js** are implemented : 

+ bar charts,
+ line charts,
+ pie charts,
+ doughnut charts,
+ radar charts,
+ polar area charts

## Improvements

### Colors

Base colors imported from the Paired palette of [ColorBrewer](http://www.colorbrewer2.org) are available by default. It allows having a light color to represent the data which turns into a stronger color when highlighted.

### Legends

Legends can be generated in **Chart.js** but this has to be done manually. Here, legends are automatically generated and placed in a separate container next to the graph.

### Future improvements

There are several things on my todo list : 

+ make it possible to pass options to graphs for more customization,
+ implement the [Chart.StackedBar](https://github.com/Regaddi/Chart.StackedBar.js) extension,
+ the legend for Bar Charts can be mouseovered to highlight the corresponding series, I would like to extend this functionality to the other graph types,
+ make it possible to have a *subdue* mode for graphs where the strong color is present by default and highlighting turns the colors of the non-highlighted elements to the light color. This would make the elements stand out more in the default state.
